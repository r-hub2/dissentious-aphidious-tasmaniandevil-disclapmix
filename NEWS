Changes in version 1.7.5
  * New vignette "Adaptive fitting"
  * `disclapmix_adaptive()`:
      - Allowing to take `label` and generators for `init_y` (`init_y_generator`) and 
        `init_v` (`init_v_generator`) - refer to the "Adaptive fitting" vignette.
      - Allowing `disclapmix_adaptive()` to take multiple `criteria`'s 
      - Not necessary to supply `_marginal` suffix for `criteria`
  * Add `cluster` argument to `simulate()` to force simulating from a 
    particular cluster
  * `disclapmix()` for `glm_method` `glm.fit`: `covmat` calculated more efficiently
  * Parameters for `disclapmix_robust()` controlling retries with random subsets
  * Include check for if data contains `NA`'s
  * New `init_y_method`: `hclust`
  * `predict` can now accept NA values, in which case that locus is 
    ignored (corresponding to marginalising over that locus).
  * Remove "fwsim" Suggest
  * Add `export_compact_fit` method for easier exporting fits for prediction (e.g., to JSON)
  * CRAN fixes

Changes in version 1.7.4
  * `disclapmix()` takes new agument: `init_v` (initial posterior probabilities 
     to get EM started)
  * `disclapmix()` takes new agument: `ret_x` of whether to return data or 
     not -- the default is not to (as opposed to earlier behaviour)
  * Added function `disclapmix_robust()` which is a wrapper 
    around `disclapmix()` that tries to avoid errors. 
    Can sometimes avoid errors with svd problems.
  * Added function `disclapmix_adaptive()` which is a wrapper around 
    `disclapmix_robust()` that instead of fitting one model for a given 
    number of clusters, fits models until the best model (lowest marginal BIC) 
    is in the interior (with margin `M`) of all number of clusters tried. 
    E.g., the best model has 3 clusters and the margin `M = 5`, then 
    this function ensures that models with 1, 2, ..., 3+5 = 8 clusters 
    are fitted. If e.g. then 7 is better than 3, then it continues such that 
    also models with up to 7+5 = 12 clusters are fitted.    
  
Changes in version 1.7.3
  * Adding suppressWarnings(RNGversion("3.5.0")) to tests as a result 
    of https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17494.

Changes in version 1.7.2
  * Maintenance updates
  * Remove Makevars files as not required by Rcpp >= 0.11.

Changes in version 1.7.1
  * Tag for the The Journal of Open Source Software paper: 
    http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00748

Changes in version 1.7
  * Moving to Github
  * Roxygen
  * testthat
  * Travis CI
  
Changes in version 1.6.3
  * Avoid two centers being equal (mainly a problem for very few loci)
  * Internal: PedigreeSums added with increased stack size and progress indicator
  
Changes in version 1.6.2
  * Minor technical changes for keeping CRAN checks happy
    
Changes in version 1.6.1
  * Plot functionality for disclapmix was broken for fits with only one 
    subpopulation/cluster.

Changes in version 1.6
  * Plot functionality for disclapmix fit takes an argument for the 
    distances between clusters (defaults to clusterdist(x)). This
    can be used if the distances have been precalculated.
  * Minor technical changes for keeping CRAN checks happy
  
Changes in version 1.5
  * Added AICc (Akaike Information Criterium with finite sample correction)
  * Added plot functionality for a disclapmix fit
  * Corrected number of model observations, leading to corrected BIC values (AIC not affected)
  * Error in full likelihood ratio corrected (not used for model selection)
    
Changes in version 1.4
  * Added separation of two persons mixtures (see example in ?rank_contributor_pairs)
  * Added AIC (Akaike Information Criterium) for a model disclapmixfit

Changes in version 1.3
  * Added simulate from fitted model
  * Added haplotype diversity calculation from a fitted model
  * Added parameter to control number of IRLS iterations (glm_control_maxit)
  * Added parameter to control IRLS convergence (glm_control_eps)
  * Changed default iterations to 100L, glm_control_maxit to 50L and 
    glm_control_eps to 1e-6
  * Fixed error with no IRLS output for verbose = 2L expect for glm.fit
  * Small changes in verbose output
  
Changes in version 1.2
  * Changed default glm_method to internal_coef due to speed considerations
  * Fixed issues when having one cluster, one locus or both

Changes in version 1.1
  * Code changes for OS X, Windows and Solaris compatibility

Changes in version 1.0
  * Totally rewritten such that the algorithm is more memory and CPU 
    efficient and can be used to analyse larger datasets
  * Internal IRLS algorithm implemented, much faster than glm.fit for this
    kind of data. glm.fit is still available. See glm_method in ?disclapmix.
  * NOTE: Updated API

Changes in version 0.4
  * Fixed error when there is no variation in a subpopulation

Changes in version 0.3
  * Fixed error such that verbose = 1 outputs progress information
  * Number of model parameters corrected, which changes marginal and
    full BIC slightly, but only with a constant change meaning that for the 
    same data, the optimal number of centers is the same

Changes in version 0.2
	* disclapmix: verbose more fine grained
	* FIXED: disclapmix: use.parallel = TRUE created problems under Windows
	* Corrected minor documentation errors

Changes in version 0.1
	* Initial release
